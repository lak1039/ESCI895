# ESCI895
Some what confusingly, my most updated code is the tryPOT.py file, so you should run that first.
I am planning to add a figure comparing the disributions for each river similar to the graph we made in Lab 5.
I still need to write up my results/discussion/conlusion this weekend.
My jupyter file is slightly out of date but is along the lines of what I will be finishing this weekend.
Also, let me know if you would like me to send any of the files over email, or another way that is easier than this to download.
