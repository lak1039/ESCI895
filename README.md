Some what confusingly, my most updated code is the tryPOT.py file, so you should run that first.
I am planning to add a figure comparing the disributions for each river similar to the graph we made in Lab 5.
I still need to write up my results/discussion/conlusion this weekend.
My jupyter file is slightly out of date but is a long the lines of what I will be finishing this weekend.

Best,
Lauren
